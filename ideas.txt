local variables
- very important
- works by:
  - push/pop into variables (ie push VAR, pop VAR)
  - we keep a stack of stackframes (variable maps (map[string]int64))
  - stack frames are pushed/popped with function calls

indirect function calls
- some loadfn instruction
- some callfn instruction

bitwise & logical and/or/xor/not
negate (neg)
bit shift left/right (maybe shl/shr ?)

far down the road ;)
- different data types (float64, float32, int32 should be all we need (or maybe uints too?) )
- straight memory access via load/store (would allow for pointers)
- structs
- native imports
